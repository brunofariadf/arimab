Description: The arimab is a wrapper of the r-base arima function with the addition of a formula to model the time series with inclusion of covariates in the model. In addition, the pre-bleaching method is added to analyze the correlation of covariates with the response variable based on Box etc al (2014) and Cryer and Chan (2008).
